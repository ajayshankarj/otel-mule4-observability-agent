// Document body
== Introduction

The Mule 4 OTel Agent is a custom MuleSoft *extension* for instrumenting MuleSoft applications to export tracing 
specific *telemetry* data to any OpenTelemetry compliant collector.  Using the agent now allows Mule applications 
to be insightful participants in the overall *distributed trace*.

== The Why on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

The motivation behind developing this extension is predicated on *two primary concerns* as it 
relates to enterprise software:

* Composability
* Observability

=== Composability

.What exactly is composability and why does it matter?

Well, as you might imagine, there are plenty of 
theoretical, complex and technical answers to this question - just Google it to get a list of the numerous publications
on the topic. Since this is not a technical article on the subject of composability, we'll take a much more modest view of it.

So, in really simple terms, *_composibility_* is the concept of building stand alone software *composed* of 
other stand alone software, in a plug-and-play manner (see figure <<Composable-enterprise-app-1>> below) and it matters because 
enterprises who adopt composability as a core IT practice can achieve much greater *agility* on delivering new and/or enhanced 
solutions for business in the face of rapid and ever changing market conditions - does COVID ring a bell?  

[#Composable-enterprise-app-1]

Basically, the practice of composability is a great way for an enterprise to *protect* and *grow* overall *revenue* in 
the face of both expected and unexpected change. Do you know know when or what the next crisis will be?  Exactly...

=== Composable Enterprise

https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable[Gartner] 
defines a *_Composable Enterprise_* as an organization that can innovate and adapt to changing
business needs through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities.

[NOTE] 
====
Gartner's definition of composable business operates on four basic principles: 

* More speed through *discovery*.
* Greater agility through *modularity*.
* Better leadership through *orchestration*.
* Resilience through *autonomy*.
====

Composability must be important because it has its own Gartner definition, right?

==== So how long before we have true composable enterprises? 
 
From a purist standpoint (i.e., based on the Gartner definition), 
who knows - maybe never.  However, from a practical perspective the "messy" composable enterprise is *already here*, has been 
for a while and it's quickly getting more "pure" over time.

For example,

* A typical enterprise supports over *900 applications* and the number is *growing*, not shrinking.
** Growth is happening because of:
*** Accelerated implementation of *digital transformation strategies* with a cloud-first approach.
*** Rapid adoption of a *microservices* architecture paradigm.

* Typically, no single enterprise application handles a business transaction.
** A typical *business transaction traverses over 35 different systems/applications* from start to finish.
*** These systems/applications are often on a variety of *disparate* and independent *technologies* stacks - both legacy and modern.
*** These systems are often a combination of on-prem or hosted *packaged* applications (e.g., SAP ERP, Oracle HCM, Manhattan SCM, 
etc.), *custom* coded applications and *SaaS* applications (e.g., Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday, etc.)

So as you can see, the composable enterprise already exists and will, rapidly, become more composable over time, especially,
with the support of companies like MuleSoft, products like the Anypoint Platform and methodologies like API-Led Connectivity.

////
Legos are often used has a metaphor for explaining the concept of composability.  Think of developing/constructing each 
application in your enterprise as a discrete lego with .  Then, using these discrete legos you can easily build more complex new
applications or rebuild more complex applicationsFrom these discrete blocks

=== Observability

[quote]
Wikipedia defines *observability* as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of 
its external outputs.  As it relates specifically to software, observability is the ability to collect data about program 
execution, internal states of modules, and communication between components.  This corpus of collected data is also referred 
to as *telemetry*.

Another way of looking at observability is having the capacity to introspect, in real-time, complex multi-tiered architectures to 
better answer the following:

* Where is it broken?
* Why did it break?
* Where is it slow?

Then, using those insights to fix what's broken and speedup what's slow.

==== Observability Trinity

The obtainment of true observability relies upon 3 core pillars.

image::Pillars-of-Observability.png[600, 600, title="The 3 Pillars of Observability", align="center"]

===== Metrics
A *_metric_* is a value that expresses some information about a system. Metrics are 
usually represented as counts or measures, and are often aggregated or calculated over a period of time. Additionally, metrics 
are often structured as _<name, value>_ pairs that provide useful behavioral details at both the micro-level and the macro-level 
such as the following:

.Example Metrics
|===
| *Micro-level metrics*           | *Macro-level metrics*
| Memory utilization per service  | Average response time per service
| CPU utilization per service     | Throughput rate per service
| Garbage collection time         | Failure rate per service
| ...                             | ...
|===

===== Logs

===== Traces/Distributed Traces


==== Why is observability important?  

The notion of observability is very important to IT organizations because when a business transaction fails or performs 
poorly within their application network, they need the ability to quickly triage and remediate the issue before there is any
significant impact on revenue.  

Many IT organizations have and continue to rely upon commercial Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., AppDynamics, 
Dynatrace, New Relic, CA APM, ...) to help them in this regard.  While useful, these commercial tools have l

 when struggle to get meaningful and actionable insight on a 
business transaction which fails or performs poorly within their application network.
Some organizations use commercial APM tools to help with this effort; however, APM tools are vendor specific and often leave 
'holes' in the overall observability of the transaction
They are basically trying to find a needle in a stack of needles.


==== So what does composability and observability have to do with each other?  

Well, as enterprise applications become more and more 
composable, that is, as enterprises move towards composability, the need for observability becomes greater; however, the capacity 
for it becomes harder.

== The What on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

=== OpenTelemetry

//From https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry.io]



[quote, OpenTelemetry, 'https://opentelemetry.io']
OpenTelemetry *is a* set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management 
of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The project provides a *vendor-agnostic* implementation that 
can be configured to send *telemetry data* to the backend(s) of your choice.

IMPORTANT: OpenTelemetry *is not* an observability back-end.

The OpenTelemetry open-source project is spearheaded by the Cloud
Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), with the aim of making software
more observable and to establish telemetry as a built-in feature of cloudnative software. OpenTelemetry focuses on improving the collection of
observability data, specifically metrics and distributed traces for some of
the emerging and increasingly adopted cloud frameworks.

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools , APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) 
to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry is not an observability back-end like Jaeger or Prometheus.

This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.
