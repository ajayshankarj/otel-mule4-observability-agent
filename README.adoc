// Document body
== Introduction

The Mule 4 OTel Agent is a custom MuleSoft *_extension_* that allows MuleSoft applications to be instrumented such 
that the application provides tracing *_telemetry data_* to any OpenTelemetry compliant collector and be a
participant in a larger *_distributed trace_*.

== The Why on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

The motivation behind developing this extension is predicated on *two primary concerns* as it 
relates to enterprise software:

* Composability
* Observability

=== Composability

What exactly is composability and why does it matter?  Well, as you might imagine, there are plenty of 
complicated and technical answers to this question - just Google it and you will see.

In really simple terms, *_composibility_* is the concept of building stand alone software _composed_ of 
other stand alone software and it matters because enterprises who adopt composability as a core IT practice 
can achieve much greater _agility_ on delivering new solutions for the Business in the face of rapid and ever
changing market conditions - does COVID ring a bell?  

NOTE: Gartner defines a *Composable Enterprise* as an organization that can innovate and adapt to changing
business needs through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities. 

Legos are often used has a metaphor for explaining the concept.  Think of building each application in 
your enterprise as a discrete lego.  Using these discrete legos From these discrete

=== Observability

[quote]
Wikipedia defines *_observability_* as a measure of how well internal states of a system can 
be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.  As it relates specifically to software, observability 
is the _ability to collect data about program execution, internal states of modules, and communication 
between components_.  This corpus of collected data is also referred to as *_telemetry_*.

== The What on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

=== OpenTelemetry

//From https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry.io]


[quote, OpenTelemetry, 'https://opentelemetry.io']
OpenTelemetry *is a* set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management 
of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The project provides a *vendor-agnostic* implementation that 
can be configured to send *telemetry data* to the backend(s) of your choice.

IMPORTANT: OpenTelemetry *is not* an observability back-end.

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools , APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) 
to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry is not an observability back-end like Jaeger or Prometheus.

This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.
