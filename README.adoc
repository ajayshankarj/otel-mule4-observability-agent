// Document body
== Introduction

The Mule 4 OTel Agent is a custom MuleSoft *extension* for instrumenting MuleSoft applications to export tracing 
specific *telemetry* data to any OpenTelemetry compliant collector.  Using the agent now allows Mule applications 
to be insightful participants in the overall *distributed trace*.

== The Why on the Mule 4 OTel Agent

The motivation behind developing this extension is predicated on *two primary concerns* as it 
relates to enterprise software:

* Composability
* Observability

=== Composability

.What exactly is composability and why does it matter?

Well, as you might imagine, there are plenty of 
theoretical, complex and technical answers to this question - just Google it to get a list of the numerous publications
on the topic. Since this is not a technical article on the subject of composability, we'll take a much more modest view of it.

So, in really simple terms, *_composability_* is the concept of building stand alone software *composed* of 
other stand alone software, in a plug-and-play manner (see figure <<Composable-enterprise-app-1>> below) and it matters because 
enterprises who adopt composability as a core IT practice can achieve much greater *agility* on delivering new and/or enhanced 
solutions for business in the face of rapid and ever changing market conditions - does COVID ring a bell?  

[#Composable-enterprise-app-1]

Basically, the practice of composability is a great way for an enterprise to *protect* and *grow* overall *revenue* in 
the face of both expected and unexpected change. Do you know know when or what the next crisis will be?  Exactly...

=== Composable Enterprise

https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable[Gartner] 
defines a *_Composable Enterprise_* as an organization that can innovate and adapt to changing
business needs through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities.

[NOTE] 
====
Gartner's definition of composable business operates on four basic principles: 

* More speed through *discovery*.
* Greater agility through *modularity*.
* Better leadership through *orchestration*.
* Resilience through *autonomy*.
====

Composability must be important because it has its own Gartner definition, right?

==== So how long before we have true composable enterprises? 
 
From a purist standpoint (i.e., based on the Gartner definition), 
who knows - maybe never.  However, from a practical perspective the "messy" composable enterprise is *already here*, has been 
for a while and it's quickly getting more "pure" over time.

For example,

* A typical enterprise supports over *900 applications* and the number is *growing*, not shrinking.
** Growth is happening because of:
*** Accelerated implementation of *digital transformation strategies* with a cloud-first approach.
*** Rapid adoption of a *microservices* architecture paradigm.

* Typically, no single enterprise application handles a business transaction.
** A typical *business transaction traverses over 35 different systems/applications* from start to finish.
*** These systems/applications are often on a variety of *disparate* and independent *technologies* stacks - both legacy and modern.
*** These systems are often a combination of on-prem or hosted *packaged* applications (e.g., SAP ERP, Oracle HCM, Manhattan SCM, 
etc.), *custom* coded applications and *SaaS* applications (e.g., Salesforce, NetSuite, Workday, etc.)

So as you can see, the composable enterprise already exists and will, rapidly, become more composable over time, especially,
with the support of companies like MuleSoft, products like the Anypoint Platform and methodologies like API-Led Connectivity.

////
Legos are often used has a metaphor for explaining the concept of composability.  Think of developing/constructing each 
application in your enterprise as a discrete lego with .  Then, using these discrete legos you can easily build more complex new
applications or rebuild more complex applicationsFrom these discrete blocks

=== Observability

[quote]
Wikipedia defines *observability* as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of 
its external outputs.  As it relates specifically to software, observability is the ability to collect *data about program 
execution, internal states of modules, and communication between components*.  This corpus of collected data is also referred 
to as *telemetry*.

Another way of looking at observability is having the capacity to introspect, in real-time, complex multi-tiered architectures to 
better answer the following when things so sideways:

* Where and why is it broken?
* Where and why is it slow?

Then, using the gathered observability insights to quickly fix what's broken and speedup what's slow.

[NOTE]
====
However, I think a *more important* consideration for observability is an answer to following:

* How can I *proactively* protect against failure and poor performance?

==== Observability Trinity

The obtainment of true observability relies upon 3 core pillars.

image::Pillars-of-Observability.png[600, 600, title="The 3 Pillars of Observability", align="center"]

===== Metrics
A *_metric_* is a value that expresses some information about a system. Metrics are 
usually represented as counts or measures, and are often aggregated or calculated over a period of time. Additionally, metrics 
are often structured as _<name, value>_ pairs that provide useful behavioral details at both the micro-level and the macro-level 
such as the following:

.Example Metrics
|===
| *Micro-level metrics*           | *Macro-level metrics*
| Memory utilization per service  | Average response time per service
| CPU utilization per service     | Throughput rate per service
| Thread count                    | Failure rate per service
| ...                             | ...
|===

image::Macro-Micro-Metrics.png[title="Micro-level and Macro-level Metrics", align="center"]

===== Logs
A *log* is an immutable, time-stamped text or binary record, either structured (recommended) or unstructured, potentially including 
metadata. The log record is generated by application code in response to an event (e.g., an error condition) which has occurred
during program execution.

.Example of a structured log record
[literal]
....
[02-22 08:02:50.412] ERROR OnErrorContinueHandler [ [MuleRuntime].uber.18543: [client-id-enforcement-439118-order-api-spec-main].439118-client-id-enforcement.CPU_LITE @5b1b413e] [event: d46fe7b0-93b5-11ec-b9b6-02d407c48f42]: 
Root Exception stack trace:
org.mule.runtime.api.el.ExpressionExecutionException: Script 'atributes.headers ' has errors:
...
....

.Example of a unstructured log record
 'hello world'

===== Traces
A *single trace* is an event which shows the activity for a transaction or request as it flows through an individual application. 
Whereas, a *distributed trace* is an aggregation of one or more single traces when the transaction spans across multiple  
application, network, security and environment boundaries.  For example, a distributed trace may be initiated when someone presses a 
button to start an action on a website - such as purchasing a product.  In this case, the distributed trace will represent calls made 
between all of the downstream services (e.g. Inventory, Logistics, Payment, etc.) that handled the chain of requests initiated by 
the initial button press.

*Distributed tracing* is the methodology implemented by tracing tools to generate, follow, analyze and debug a distributed trace.
Generation of a distributed trace is accomplished by tagging the transaction with a unique identifier and propagating that identifier
through the chain of systems involved in the transaction.  This process is also referred to as *trace context propagation*.


Traces are a critical part of observability, as they provide context for other telemetry. For example, traces can help define 
which metrics would be most valuable in a given situation, or which logs are relevant to a particular issue.

image::Distributed-Trace-Example.png[title="Example of a Distributed Trace", align="center"]

==== Why is observability important?  

The notion of observability is very important to IT organizations because when a business transaction fails or performs 
poorly within their application network, the team needs the ability to quickly *triage* and *remediate* the root cause 
before there is any significant impact on revenue.  

Many IT organizations have and continue to rely upon commercial Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tools (e.g., AppDynamics, 
Dynatrace, New Relic, CA APM, ...) to help them in this regard.  While useful, these commercial tools have struggled in the past
to provide complete visibility into the overall distributed trace as they deploy vendor specific agents to collect and forward 
their telemetry.

I state "_struggled in the past_" because many APM vendors are now starting to embrace and support open source projects like 
https://opentelemetry.io/docs/reference/specification/overview/[OpenTelemetry] for vendor-agnostic instrumentation agent 
implementations and standards such as https://www.w3.org/TR/trace-context/[W3C Trace Context] for context propagation 
to help them fill in the "holes".

==== So what do composability and observability have to do with each other?  

Hopefully, the answer is obvious but as enterprise applications become more and more composable, that is, as enterprises move 
towards embracing composability as an architectural pattern, the need for observability becomes greater; however, the capacity 
for implementing observability becomes harder unless there is comprehensive observability strategy and solution in place.

=== Solving for Observability

MuleSoft has traditionally been a very strong player in two aspects of the Observability Trinity - Metrics and Logs.  Anypoint 
Monitoring provides considerable support and functionality for these two observability data sources.  However, there has been a gap
in the support for tracing (single traces and distributed traces).  This limitation within the current offering is the inspiration
behind the development of the custom extension. 

Together, *Anypoint Monitoring and Mule 4 Otel Agent* offer a more comprehensive and robust observability solution and should be 
part of an enterprise's overall observability solution.

== The What on the Mule 4 OTel Agent

=== OpenTelemetry

[quote, OpenTelemetry, 'https://opentelemetry.io']
OpenTelemetry *is a set* of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management 
of *telemetry data* such as traces, metrics, and logs. The project provides a *vendor-agnostic* implementation that 
can be configured to send telemetry data to the backend(s) of your choice.

IMPORTANT: OpenTelemetry *is not* an observability back-end.

As noted above, OpenTelemetry is a *framework* which provides a single, vendor-agnostic solution with the purpose 
of standardizing the generation, emittance, collection, processing and exporting of telemetry data in support of observability.
OpenTelemetry was established in 2019 as an open source project and is spearheaded by the CloudNative Computing Foundation (CNCF).

[NOTE]
====
In 2019, the https://opencensus.io/[OpenCensus] and https://opentracing.io/[OpenTracing] projects merged into OpenTelemetry. 
Currently, OpenTelemetry is at the "*incubating*" https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/process/graduation_criteria.adoc[maturity 
level] (up from "sandbox" level a year back) and is one of the most popular projects across the CNCF landscape.
====

==== OpenTelemetry Reference Architecture

Being a CNCF supported project, it's no surprise the architecture of OpenTelemetry is cloud friendly - which also implies that 
it is friendly to all distributed environments. While there are various aspects to the overall OpenTelemetry framework (e.g.,
API, SDK, Signals, Packages, Propagators, Exporters, etc.), the functional architecture is relatively simple with regard to 
client-side implementation as seen in the diagram below.

image::Otel-Ref-Arch-2-shadowing.png[800, 800, title="OpenTelemetry Reference Architecture", align="center"]

On the client side (e.g., the Mule application), there are really only two OpenTelemetry components which are used and one is optional:


OpenTelemetry Library::
* OpenTelemtry API
* OpenTelemtry SDK

OpenTelemetry Collector::
* [Optional>


There awithin the architecture, each component is 
implemented as a discrete capability


==== MuleSoft OpenTelemetry Agent Architecture

image::Agent-Arch.png[700, 700, title="Mule Agent Architecture", align="center"]


This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.
