// Document body
== Introduction

The Mule 4 OTel Agent is a custom MuleSoft *extension* for instrumenting MuleSoft applications to export tracing 
specific *telemetry* data to any OpenTelemetry compliant collector and be an insightful participant in the overall 
*distributed trace*.

== The Why on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

The motivation behind developing this extension is predicated on *two primary concerns* as it 
relates to enterprise software:

* Composability
* Observability

=== Composability

What exactly is composability and why does it matter?  Well, as you might imagine, there are plenty of 
theoretical, complex and technical answers to this question - just Google it to get a list of the numerous publications
on the topic. Since this is not a technical article on the subject, we'll take a much more modest view of it.

So, in really simple terms, *_composibility_* is the concept of building stand alone software *composed* of 
other stand alone software and it matters because enterprises who adopt composability as a core IT practice 
can achieve much greater *agility* on delivering new and/or enhanced solutions for the Business in the face of 
rapid and ever changing market conditions - does COVID ring a bell?  Basically, it's a great way for an enterprise to
protect and *grow* their *revenue*.

NOTE: Gartner defines a *_Composable Enterprise_* as an organization that can innovate and adapt to changing
business needs through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities. 

Legos are often used has a metaphor for explaining the concept.  Think of building each application in 
your enterprise as a discrete lego.  Using these discrete legos From these discrete blocks

=== Observability

[quote]
Wikipedia defines *_observability_* as a measure of how well internal states of a system can 
be inferred from knowledge of its external outputs.  As it relates specifically to software, observability 
is the _ability to collect data about program execution, internal states of modules, and communication 
between components_.  This corpus of collected data is also referred to as *_telemetry_*.

== The What on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

=== OpenTelemetry

//From https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry.io]



[quote, OpenTelemetry, 'https://opentelemetry.io']
OpenTelemetry *is a* set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management 
of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The project provides a *vendor-agnostic* implementation that 
can be configured to send *telemetry data* to the backend(s) of your choice.

IMPORTANT: OpenTelemetry *is not* an observability back-end.

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools , APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) 
to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry is not an observability back-end like Jaeger or Prometheus.

This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.
