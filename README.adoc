// Document body
== Introduction

The Mule 4 OTel Agent is a custom MuleSoft *extension* for instrumenting MuleSoft applications to export tracing 
specific *telemetry* data to any OpenTelemetry compliant collector.  Using the agent now allows Mule applications 
to be insightful participants in the overall *distributed trace*.

== The Why on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

The motivation behind developing this extension is predicated on *two primary concerns* as it 
relates to enterprise software:

* Composability
* Observability

=== Composability

.What exactly is composability and why does it matter?  
Well, as you might imagine, there are plenty of 
theoretical, complex and technical answers to this question - just Google it to get a list of the numerous publications
on the topic. Since this is not a technical article on the subject of composability, we'll take a much more modest view of it.

So, in really simple terms, *_composibility_* is the concept of building stand alone software *composed* of 
other stand alone software, in a plug-and-play manner (see figure <<Composable-enterprise-app-1>> below) and it matters because 
enterprises who adopt composability as a core IT practice can achieve much greater *agility* on delivering new and/or enhanced 
solutions for business in the face of rapid and ever changing market conditions - does COVID ring a bell?  

[#Composable-enterprise-app-1]

Basically, the practice of composability is a great way for an enterprise to *protect* and *grow* overall *revenue* in 
the face of both expected and unexpected change. 

==== Composable Enterprise

https://www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartner-keynote-the-future-of-business-is-composable[Gartner] 
defines a *_Composable Enterprise_* as an organization that can innovate and adapt to changing
business needs through the assembly and combination of packaged business capabilities.

[NOTE] 
====
Gartner's definition of composable business operates on four basic principles: 

* More speed through *discovery*.
* Greater agility through *modularity*.
* Better leadership through *orchestration*.
* Resilience through *autonomy*.
====

Composability must be important because it has its own Gartner definition, right?

.So how long before we have true composable enterprises?  
From a purist standpoint (i.e., based on the Gartner definition), 
who knows - maybe never.  However, from a practical perspective the "messy" *composable enterprise is already here*, has been 
for a while and it's quickly getting more "pure" over time.

For example,

* A typical enterprise supports over *900 applications* and the number is *growing*, not shrinking.
** Growth is happening because of:
*** Accelerated implementation of digital transformation strategies with a cloud-first approach.
*** Rapid adoption of a microservices architecture paradigm.

* Typically, no single enterprise application handles a business transaction.
** A typical *business transaction traverses over 35 different systems/applications* from start to finish.
*** These systems/applications are often on a variety of disparate and independent technologies stacks - both legacy and modern.
*** These systems are often a combination of either on-prem or hosted packaged applications (e..g, SAP ERP, Oracle HCM, ...)
and SaaS applications (Salesforce, NetSuite, ...)

So as you can see, the composable enterprise already exists and will, rapidly, become more composable over time with the support of
companies like MuleSoft, products like the Anypoint Platform and methodologies like API-Led Connectivity.

Legos are often used has a metaphor for explaining the concept of composability.  Think of developing/constructing each 
application in your enterprise as a discrete lego with .  Then, using these discrete legos you can easily build more complex new
applications or rebuild more complex applicationsFrom these discrete blocks

=== Observability

[quote]
Wikipedia defines *_observability_* as a measure of how well internal states of a system can be inferred from knowledge of 
its external outputs.  As it relates specifically to software, observability is the _ability to collect data about program 
execution, internal states of modules, and communication between components.  This corpus of collected data is also referred 
to as *_telemetry_*.


.Why is observability important?  

So what does composability and observability have to do with each other?  Well, as enterprise applications become more and more 
composable, that is, as enterprises move towards composability, the need for observability becomes greater; however, the capacity 
for it becomes harder.

== The What on the OTel Mule 4 Agent

=== OpenTelemetry

//From https://opentelemetry.io[OpenTelemetry.io]



[quote, OpenTelemetry, 'https://opentelemetry.io']
OpenTelemetry *is a* set of APIs, SDKs, tooling and integrations that are designed for the creation and management 
of telemetry data such as traces, metrics, and logs. The project provides a *vendor-agnostic* implementation that 
can be configured to send *telemetry data* to the backend(s) of your choice.

IMPORTANT: OpenTelemetry *is not* an observability back-end.

The OpenTelemetry open-source project is spearheaded by the Cloud
Native Computing Foundation (CNCF), with the aim of making software
more observable and to establish telemetry as a built-in feature of cloudnative software. OpenTelemetry focuses on improving the collection of
observability data, specifically metrics and distributed traces for some of
the emerging and increasingly adopted cloud frameworks.

OpenTelemetry is a collection of tools , APIs, and SDKs. Use it to instrument, generate, collect, and export telemetry data (metrics, logs, and traces) 
to help you analyze your software's performance and behavior. OpenTelemetry is not an observability back-end like Jaeger or Prometheus.

This *purpose* of this mule extension is to allow Mule Applications participate in OpenTelemetry-based distributed traces.
